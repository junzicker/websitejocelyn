         <h2>Goals for Class</h2>
         <p>I am taking this class to see if development is something that I want to pursue in my career. I love learning foreign languages and see this as an extension of that.</p>
         <p>Hopefully, I'll learn enough HTML/CSS to be able to help the customers that I assist everyday in my current career with more advanced troubleshooting.</p>

         <h2>Concerns for Class</h2>
         <p><ul>
           <li>Time commitment and mangement</li>
           <li>Falling behind once I don't understand one little thing</li>
           <li>Not being creative enough to design something worthwhile. I am good at following instrcutions, but have a hard time coming up with something from scratch.</li>
           <li>I'm comfortable with HTML and familiar with CSS, but I'm nervous for learning Git, the command line, and javascript.</li>
         </ul></p>

         <h2>Every Card has a title</h2>
         <p>This card has a <b>paragraph</b> of <font color="red">text </font> with a <a href="https://portlandcodeschool.github.io/primer/lessons/prep_work/">link. </a> It also has a second <u>sentence</u> of <span id="strikethrough">text</span> with a
           <a
           href="https://portlandcodeschool.github.io/primer/lessons/prep_work/"> link</a>
         </p>
         <p>A card is a simple unit of information. We'll use the &lt;article&gt; tag to represent a card and then style it with CSS.

         <h2>Every Card has a width</h2>
         <p><b>But</b> we <em>never</em> use pixels &#40;px&#41; to determine the size of a card.</p>
         <p> We use measurements that flex, like percents &#40;&#37;&#41;, or that relate to the size of the content, like <em> root &#34;em&#34; </em> units &#40;rem&#41;, which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable</p>

         <h2> This card has lists </h2>
         <p> Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation &#40;a list of links&#41; &#58;
           <ul>
             <li><a href="www.wufoo.com">go here</a></li>
             <li><a href="www.wufoo.com">go there</a></li>
             <li><a href="www.wufoo.com">go someplace else</a></li>
           </ul>
         </p>
         <p> Or as a way to display sets of things</p>
         <p>My Favorite Colors
           <ul>
             <li id="red">red</li>
             <li id="blue">blue</li>
             <li id="green">green</li>
           </ul>
         </P>
         <p>
           You will use lists a lot. </p>
